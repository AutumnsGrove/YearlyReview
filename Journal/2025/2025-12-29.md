# Journal

## **Monday, December 29th 2025** |✱| *07:15 am*
Last few days of the year. Wild how fast it went by.

Made pancakes for breakfast - tried that new recipe with the buttermilk and they turned out pretty good. Need to write it down somewhere so I don't forget the ratios.

Today's plan is mostly cleaning and organizing. Want to start the new year with a fresh space. The closet situation has gotten out of control.

Took a break from cleaning. Found a bunch of old photos while going through boxes - some from the trip to the mountains last spring. Should really back those up somewhere.

[[Alex]] texted about New Year's plans. Thinking low-key this year - maybe just a small dinner thing. The idea of a big party sounds exhausting honestly.

Back to the closet. I've already filled two donation bags which feels productive. Amazing how much stuff accumulates over a year.
