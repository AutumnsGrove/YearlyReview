Good morning! Grabbed coffee at the usual spot downtown. The barista remembered my order which was nice. Planning to spend the afternoon at the library working on that side project.

The weather is getting colder - saw frost on the car this morning. Need to remember to grab my winter coat from storage this weekend.

Thinking about picking up some new books while I'm at the library. [[Sarah]] recommended that sci-fi series last week and I keep forgetting to check it out.

Later I might swing by the hardware store. The kitchen faucet has been dripping and it's driving me crazy. Hopefully it's an easy fix - just need a new washer probably.

Looking forward to the weekend. [[Mike]] mentioned something about a board game night on Saturday which sounds fun.
