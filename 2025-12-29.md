# Journal

## **Monday, December 29th 2025** |✱| *07:15 am*
good morning! second to last day at work <:

so excited to not work there. im feeling REALLLYYY sleepy this morning. its starting to catch up to me.

i got some breakfast, and i can barely eat it. i. kinda need to use the restroom, so maybe thats it, but also, i am feeling the [[Morning Nausea]] (throwback document!!!)

today is work. i believe that is it! i want to code more today. get auth working. get everything set up for Plant so new users can sign in. ugh im so excited!! but im also so sleepyyyy like i could sleep for the next 2 hours no sweat. part of me is _tempted_ to just sleep in my car for a bit, rest my eyes, but, at the same time, i dont know if i can just _do_ that. i think i’d be too in my head about being late.

i hope i get one of those crisp and fresh aprons so that everyone in the building can give me some goodby wishes. that would be neat.

ok i cant get a BIG apron BUT i _can_ get the half height one that the MET team uses. I think [[Ron]] put one out for me - a lot of people have noticed that I’m leaving. I’ve talked a lot with [[Camille]], [[Emily]], and a little bit with [[Nicole]] about what’s going on. Also, when [[Collin]] saw me, the first thing he said is “Take me with you” and he seemed really… upset honestly. I think he’s really struggling with his situation too. oh and i also saw [[Tim]]!! I haven’t seen tim in so long 🥺

anyways. im feeling pretty good. the work today is solid - cleanup the tool bai, the one for gardening tools like a pickaxe and shit. not too bad. good amount to do - enough to keep me busy for a while. its nice being busy, at least.

im gonna try another round of breakfast. i tried to eat the mcdonalds i got earlier and i just… couldnt. i was feeling too nauseous. so far im feeling fine.

today is gonna be a good day. i can feel it :)
