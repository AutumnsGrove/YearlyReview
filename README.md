# BaseProject - Claude Code Template

A comprehensive project template with built-in Claude Code workflows, best practices, and extensive documentation for rapid development setup.

**What you get:** Git hooks • Multi-language support • Security defaults • 18 comprehensive guides • Claude-optimized workflows

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: New Project Setup

**Copy this prompt into Claude Code:**
```
I want to create a new project from the BaseProject template. Follow this workflow:

1. First, ask me for: project name, description, tech stack (Python/JS/Go), and what API keys I'll need
2. Clone https://github.com/AutumnsGrove/BaseProject (main branch) to /tmp
3. Copy to ~/Projects/[PROJECT_NAME] (exclude .git/)
4. Copy .claude/skills/ folder (Claude Code Skills are the primary workflow mechanism)
5. Customize AGENT.md with my project details (Purpose, Tech Stack, Architecture)
6. Update README.md with project-specific info (title, description, features)
7. Init language dependencies (uv init for Python, pnpm init for JS, go mod init for Go)
8. Create directory structure: src/ and tests/ with proper init files for the chosen language
9. Generate secrets_template.json with my API key placeholders
10. Create TODOS.md with 3-5 starter tasks based on the project description
11. Run git init using global git config (user.name and user.email)
12. Ask if I want to install git hooks (recommended: yes, auto-detects language from files created in step 7)
13. If yes, run ./AgentUsage/pre_commit_hooks/install_hooks.sh
14. Ask if I want to install house-agents (recommended: yes, includes house-coder and house-planner)
15. If yes, check if ~/.claude/agents/house-research.md exists; if not, clone https://github.com/AutumnsGrove/house-agents.git and copy agents to ~/.claude/agents/
16. Make initial commit: "feat: initialize [PROJECT] from BaseProject template"
17. Display project summary including available skills and next steps

Start by asking me for the project details.
```

Claude will interactively:
- Ask for project name, tech stack, and requirements
- Copy BaseProject template to your chosen location
- **Install Claude Code Skills** - the primary mechanism for specialized workflows
- Customize AGENT.md with your project details
- Set up language-specific dependencies (pyproject.toml, package.json, etc.)
- Create proper project structure (src/, tests/)
- Generate secrets_template.json with your needed API keys
- Initialize git with proper configuration
- **Install git hooks (recommended)** - auto-detects your language and installs:
  - Code quality checks (Black/Ruff for Python, Prettier/ESLint for JS, gofmt for Go)
  - Security scanner (prevents committing API keys/secrets)
  - Test runner (blocks push if tests fail)
  - Dependency auto-updater (runs on branch switch)
- **Install house-agents (recommended)** - includes all 5 specialized agents:
  - house-research, house-git, house-bash (from upstream)
  - house-coder, house-planner (from AutumnsGrove fork)
  - Skips if agents already installed
- Create initial commit following our standards

---

### Option 2: Add to Existing Project

**Copy this prompt into Claude Code (run in your project directory):**

```
I want to add BaseProject structure to my CURRENT project. Follow this workflow:

1. Analyze my existing project: read README.md, AGENT.md, git history for commit patterns, detect tech stack and package managers, identify architecture (monorepo/single/etc), read TODOS.md if exists
2. Clone https://github.com/AutumnsGrove/BaseProject (main branch) to /tmp/bp
3. Copy .claude/skills/ folder to my project (Claude Code Skills are the primary workflow mechanism)
4. Copy AgentUsage/ to my project (preserve any existing AgentUsage/ files, only add new guides - these serve as extended reference)
5. Intelligently merge AGENT.md: if exists, parse sections and merge BaseProject sections using markers like "<!-- BaseProject: Git Workflow -->". If doesn't exist, create from template with detected project details. Ensure skills usage instructions are included.
6. Enhance .gitignore by merging entries (preserve existing, add missing from BaseProject)
7. Analyze commit messages and suggest adopting BaseProject conventional commit style if inconsistent
8. Check if using branches like dev/main and suggest workflow if not
9. Ask if I want to install git hooks (they auto-detect my language and back up existing hooks first)
10. If yes, run ./AgentUsage/pre_commit_hooks/install_hooks.sh interactively
11. Ask if I want to install house-agents (includes house-coder and house-planner for enhanced workflows)
12. If yes, check if ~/.claude/agents/house-research.md exists; if not, clone https://github.com/AutumnsGrove/house-agents.git and copy agents to ~/.claude/agents/
13. Generate/update TODOS.md with project-aware tasks
14. Create integration-summary.md report showing what was added/merged/skipped (including skills list)
15. Backup all modified files to ./.baseproject-backup-[TIMESTAMP]/
16. Cleanup /tmp/bp
17. Display next steps including available skills

Start by analyzing my current project.
```

Claude will intelligently:
- Analyze your existing project structure and conventions
- Detect tech stack from package files (package.json, pyproject.toml, etc.)
- **Install Claude Code Skills** - the primary mechanism for specialized workflows
- Copy AgentUsage/ guides without overwriting existing files (extended reference docs)
- Merge AGENT.md sections with clear markers (preserves your content, adds skills instructions)
- Append missing .gitignore entries without removing existing ones
- Compare your commit style to BaseProject standards and offer suggestions
- **Optionally install git hooks** - backs up existing hooks, auto-detects language, installs appropriate quality/security hooks
- **Optionally install house-agents** - includes house-coder and house-planner, skips if already installed
- Create backup of all modified files before making changes
- Generate integration-summary.md showing exactly what was changed (including available skills)
- Respect your existing README.md (won't overwrite)
- Adapt to your project's existing structure

---

### Option 3: Update/Sync Existing BaseProject Installation

**Already using BaseProject? Keep your AgentUsage docs and hooks up to date!**

This option is for projects that already have BaseProject installed and want to sync with the latest updates.

**Quick Update (Automated Script):**

```bash
# In your project directory
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AutumnsGrove/BaseProject/main/update_baseproject.sh | bash

# OR if you have BaseProject cloned locally:
bash /path/to/BaseProject/update_baseproject.sh
```

**What the Update Script Does:**

1. **Detects and migrates old folders**:
   - Finds old `ClaudeUsage` folders and migrates them to `AgentUsage`
   - Backs up everything before making changes

2. **Syncs Claude Code Skills** (Primary):
   - Updates all skills in `.claude/skills/` with latest versions
   - Skills are the primary mechanism for specialized workflows
   - Lists all available skills after sync

3. **Syncs AgentUsage folder** (Extended Reference):
   - Updates all documentation guides with latest versions
   - Refreshes git hooks with newest implementations
   - Updates templates and examples
   - Shows detailed summary of added/updated/unchanged files

4. **Merges .gitignore entries**:
   - Adds new patterns from BaseProject
   - Preserves all your existing entries

5. **Preserves your customizations**:
   - ✅ Keeps your `AGENT.md` (project instructions)
   - ✅ Keeps your `README.md` (project documentation)
   - ✅ Keeps your `TODOS.md` (task list)
   - ✅ Keeps your `secrets.json` and `secrets_template.json`
   - ✅ Keeps all language-specific files (pyproject.toml, package.json, etc.)
   - ✅ Keeps all your source code

6. **Provides update summary**:
   - Creates `baseproject-update-summary.md` with detailed changes
   - Lists available skills and their purposes
   - Creates backup in `.baseproject-backup-[TIMESTAMP]/`
   - Shows exactly what was changed and why

**Manual Update (via Claude Code):**

```
I want to update my BaseProject installation. Follow this workflow:

1. Check current directory for existing .claude/skills/, AgentUsage, or old ClaudeUsage folders
2. Clone https://github.com/AutumnsGrove/BaseProject (main branch) to /tmp/bp-update
3. Create backup of existing files to .baseproject-backup-[TIMESTAMP]/
4. If ClaudeUsage folder exists:
   - Back it up to .baseproject-backup-[TIMESTAMP]/
   - Migrate contents to AgentUsage (preserve custom files, merge intelligently)
5. Sync .claude/skills/ folder from BaseProject (Skills are the PRIMARY workflow mechanism):
   - Compare each file (add new, update changed, preserve unchanged)
   - Show summary of added/updated/unchanged skills
   - List all available skills after sync
6. Sync AgentUsage folder from BaseProject (Extended reference docs):
   - Compare each file (add new, update changed, preserve unchanged)
   - Show summary of added/updated/unchanged files
   - Keep any custom guides I've added
7. Update .gitignore by merging new entries (don't remove my existing entries)
8. Ask if I want to reinstall git hooks with latest versions
9. If yes, run ./AgentUsage/pre_commit_hooks/install_hooks.sh
10. Generate baseproject-update-summary.md report showing all changes including available skills
11. DO NOT touch: AGENT.md, README.md, TODOS.md, secrets files, language configs, source code
12. Cleanup phase:
    - Delete old ClaudeUsage folder (if it was migrated)
    - Cleanup /tmp/bp-update
13. Commit the updates with message "chore: sync BaseProject skills and docs" (do NOT include baseproject-update-summary.md in the commit - only commit the actual file changes)
14. Display summary including available skills and next steps

Start the update process.
```

**When to Use This Option:**

- ✅ Your project already has BaseProject installed (AgentUsage folder exists)
- ✅ You want to get the latest documentation guides and git hooks
- ✅ You're migrating from old "ClaudeUsage" naming to "AgentUsage"
- ✅ You want to keep your project setup but refresh the docs

**Example Output:**

```bash
$ bash update_baseproject.sh

### Option 4: Project Content Imported - Build From What's Here

**Already copied your project files in but still have all the template scaffolding? Use this!**

This is for when you've imported your existing project content (specs, license, scripts, tools, etc.) but the BaseProject template files (AGENT.md, README.md, TODOS.md) still have placeholder text.

**Copy this prompt into Claude Code:**
```
I've imported my project content into the BaseProject template, but the template files still have placeholders. Analyze everything and build out the project properly. Follow this workflow:

1. Deep Analysis Phase:
   - Read ALL files in the project to understand what exists
   - Identify: project specs, documentation, licenses, scripts, tools, configs
   - Detect tech stack from existing files (package.json, pyproject.toml, go.mod, etc.)
   - Map the current file structure and identify what belongs where
   - Note any existing README, SPEC, or documentation files that should replace template placeholders

2. Create Reorganization Plan:
   - Propose a clean directory structure based on what you found
   - Plan where specs/docs should live (e.g., move SPEC.md to docs/)
   - Identify which template files to replace vs. populate
   - List all files that will be created, moved, or modified
   - Present the plan and ask for confirmation before proceeding

3. Execute the Plan (after confirmation):
   - Create necessary directories (src/, docs/, tests/, etc.)
   - Move/reorganize files according to the plan
   - Update all file path references in moved files
   - Replace template AGENT.md with real project details extracted from specs
   - Replace template README.md with project-appropriate content
   - Generate TODOS.md with actual next steps based on project state
   - Update .gitignore for the detected tech stack
   - Create any missing standard files (LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING.md, etc. if content exists)

4. Cross-Reference & Validation:
   - Verify all internal links/references are updated
   - Check for orphaned files or broken references
   - Ensure no duplicate documentation exists
   - Validate directory structure matches tech stack conventions

5. Finalize:
   - Initialize/update language dependencies if needed
   - Offer to install git hooks appropriate for detected tech stack
   - Create initial commit with message "feat: scaffold project from imported content"
   - Display summary of changes: files created, moved, modified, deleted
   - List recommended next steps

Start by reading everything in the project directory.
```

Claude will:
- Discover your project by reading all imported files
- Understand specs, docs, scripts, and architecture from what you've brought in
- Create a tailored reorganization plan (asks for approval first)
- Move files to proper locations (specs → docs/, source → src/, etc.)
- Update all references in moved files so nothing breaks
- Transform template placeholders into real project documentation
- Generate actionable TODOS.md based on actual project state
- Set up proper structure for your detected tech stack
- Optionally install appropriate git hooks

**When to Use This Option:**
- ✅ You copied an existing project into the BaseProject template
- ✅ Template files (AGENT.md, README.md) still have placeholder text
- ✅ You have specs, licenses, scripts, or tools that need proper organization
- ✅ You want Claude to figure out the structure from what's there
- ✅ Files need to be reorganized (e.g., SPEC.md should move to docs/)

**Example Scenario:**
```
Your imported content:
├── SPEC.md              # Full project specification
├── my-tool.py           # Main script
├── LICENSE              # Your real license
├── ProjectReadme.md     # Your actual readme (not the template one)
├── config.yaml          # Project config
├── AGENT.md             # ← Still has template placeholders
├── README.md            # ← Still the template README
└── AgentUsage/          # Template guides

After running the prompt:
├── docs/
│   └── SPEC.md          # Moved, references updated
├── src/
│   └── my-tool.py       # Organized into src/
├── config.yaml
├── LICENSE
├── AGENT.md             # ← Populated with real project details from SPEC
├── README.md            # ← Replaced with ProjectReadme.md content + enhancements
├── TODOS.md             # ← Generated from actual project state
├── AgentUsage/
└── pyproject.toml       # Created for detected Python project
```

```bash
# Clone the fork with house-coder and house-planner agents
git clone https://github.com/AutumnsGrove/house-agents.git /tmp/house-agents
cp -r /tmp/house-agents/.claude .
```

**User-Wide (all projects):**
```bash
# Clone the fork with house-coder and house-planner agents
git clone https://github.com/AutumnsGrove/house-agents.git /tmp/house-agents
mkdir -p ~/.claude/agents

# Skip if agents already exist, otherwise copy them
if [ ! -f ~/.claude/agents/house-research.md ]; then
  cp /tmp/house-agents/.claude/agents/*.md ~/.claude/agents/
  echo "House agents installed successfully!"
else
  echo "House agents already exist, skipping installation"
fi
```

**Test Installation:**
