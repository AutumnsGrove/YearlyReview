# Project Instructions

> **IMPORTANT**: This project uses `AGENT.md` for agent instructions.

## Instructions for Claude Code

**You MUST read `AGENT.md` before doing anything else.**

The `AGENT.md` file contains all project-specific instructions, workflows, and guidelines. Read it first to keep the full context in memory for this session.

All project instructions, tech stack details, architecture notes, and workflow guidelines are in:
- **`AGENT.md`** - Main project instructions (read this first)
- **`AgentUsage/`** - Detailed workflow guides and best practices

*This structure aligns with industry-standard agentic coding practices.*
