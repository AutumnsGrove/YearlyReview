Good morning. I’m at chick fil at currently, about to eat a hash brown bowl! I’m excited. It’s gonna be a lovely day. I’m excited to see Rainer tonight, as well as be at another party!! All of his friends are so lovely. And I have my little camera now, so I can take lots of pics!!

These are some photos I got a little after I woke up today, around 8:30ish I believe. A little after the sun rose. I went out back to smoke a little and it was just so beautiful! A bit chilly! Around 36 degrees this morning, it’s warmed up a little but not too much. 

I’m planning on going for a hike after breakfast! I want to take cute photos and videos with the new camera. It’ll be a nice workout, too! And I want to bring my drone. The fall colors look magnificent currently and I really want to capture them!

I’m also excited about that dorky little keyboard case for my phone coming in today. It’s gonna be really fun setting up all the little shortcuts and all that. Very excited! 

I’m also very excited to shave later. It’s been like two days but my facial hair has been growing!!! Not a fan at all!!! Makes me feel quite dysphoric.
